How to run on Linux:

Copy the example configuration file and modify it to your needs:

# cp database.conf.example database.conf
# emacs database.conf   # or nano, vim, ...

If you need to restart the processing, you may want to set last_id to
the biggest id number in your database. Otherwise the log reader
(Splitter) will start from id 1, which is definitely not what you want
if you have rows already in your database.

You'll also need mysql support for Java. It's part of Debian, so in Debian, you just need to get it:

# apt-get install libmysql-java 

You are now ready to run this thing. Make sure you've got some log
files around and pipe the file names to Splitter with find or just a
temporary file list file and redirect its contents to Splitter with
'<'.

# export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar
# find /your/files | java Splitter
